"Percent Overweight & Obese (2016): The most common metric used for assessing the prevalence of obesity is the body mass index (BMI) scale. The World Health Organization define BMI as: “a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/m2). For example, an adult who weighs 70kg and whose height is 1.75m will have a BMI of 22.9."" Measured BMI values are used to define whether an individual is considered to be underweight, healthy, overweight or obese. The WHO defines these categories using the cut-off points in the table. For example, an individual with a BMI between 25.0 and 30.0 is considered to be ‘overweight’; a BMI greater than 30.0 is defined as ‘obese’.12","Source: Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2017) - ""Obesity"".

"Produce at least as much food as import? (2019): This is based on food net trade values. A negative value could mean that a country exports enough to feed its population (rice and beans), but chooses to import a lot of food not available within the country (for example avocados and fish). A country with a positive value could also not have enough food to feed its population, but choose to export some of what they have and import less food than that.","table 29 of https://www.fao.org/3/cb4477en/online/cb4477en.html#tab30 accessed August 19, 2022"
